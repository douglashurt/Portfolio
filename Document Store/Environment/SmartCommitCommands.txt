The basic syntax for a Smart Commit message is:
<ignored text> <ISSUE_KEY> <ignored text> #<COMMAND> <optional COMMAND_ARGUMENTS>
Any text between the issue key and the command is ignored.
There are three commands you can use in your Smart Commit messages:
comment
time
transition

Examples:
JRA-123 #time 2d 5h #comment Task completed ahead of schedule #resolve
JRA-123 JRA-234 JRA-345 #resolve #time 2d 5h #comment Task completed ahead of schedule
